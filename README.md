# converting-BMP-image-to-Grayscale-from-24-bit-to-8-bit

This C++ code converts a 24-bit color BMP image into an 8-bit grayscale BMP with fewer color shades. Each pixel's red, green, and blue components are averaged to produce a grayscale value. Subsequently, an 8-bit color palette is constructed and necessary fields are adjusted. This process reduces file size while creating a grayscale image.

As it is known that 24 bit image has no color palette but 8 bir gray scale bitmap image has image palette.
